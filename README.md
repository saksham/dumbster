Dumbster Fake SMTP Server
=========================
![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/saksham/dumbster.svg)

The Dumbster is a very simple fake SMTP server designed for unit and system testing applications that send email messages.

Following are the key features of this SMTP test double

* Understands ESMTP protocol and can receive emails sent using standard frameworks such as javax.mail or Unix Mail
* All emails sent to the server can be stored irrespective of whether or not the recipient address or mailbox exists.
* Can store emails using a variety of mechanisms. All emails are indexed using the recipient address for rapid retrieval.
 * Files: stores the emails in XML files
 * In memory: stores them in memory for quick access
 * SQLite: stores them in an SQLite database 
* Exposes the emails to TCP clients using its own HTTP-like API protocol (XML over TCP)
* Provides serialization and deserialization methods on all requests and responses for constructing API clients
* Also provides a client interface library in Java that can talk with the API server
* Both SMTP and API servers are self can be started within a process or in a separate machine from where the tests can send and retrieve emails.
* Can selectively relay emails sent to specific email addresses. These addresses too can be configured via the API.
* Uses [netty](http://netty.io) for dealing with networking 
* The two servers (SMTP and API) can be started on any port


The API

Current version of the API supports the following actions:

* *CLEAR*
 * Deletes the emails for a given recipient.
 * Can be used without parameters to delete all saved emails.

* *SERVER_STATUS*
 * Queries the server status.

 * For more details, see: ServerStatusRequest.java
* *GET*
 * Retrieves the saved emails.
 * Supports specifying recipient address to selectively download emails.
 * For more details, see: GetRequest.java
* *COUNT*
 * Counts the saved emails.
 * Supports speficying recipient address to selectively counting emails.
 * For more details, see: CountRequest.java
* *RELAY*
